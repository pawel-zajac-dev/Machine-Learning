# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of introductory and intermediate Machine Learning projects, implemented in Python using libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Projects

- **Linear Regression** – predicting continuous variables (e.g., housing prices).
- **Logistic Regression** – binary classification tasks (e.g., spam detection).
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests** – classification and regression examples.
- **K-Means Clustering** – unsupervised learning for pattern discovery.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – dimensionality reduction for visualization.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – classification on non-linear datasets.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** – text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis).
