# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of introductory and intermediate Machine Learning projects, implemented in Python using libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Models

- **Supervised (Classification & Regression):** Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Bayesian Regression.
- **Unsupervised (Clustering):** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN), Spectral Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering.

## Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Factor Analysis.
